//! This contract performs a batch of atomic token swaps between multiple
//! parties and does a simple price matching.
//! Parties don't need to know each other and also don't need to know their
//! signatures are used in this contract; they sign the `AtomicSwap` contract
//! invocation that guarantees that their token will be swapped with someone
//! while following the price limit.
//! This example demonstrates how authorized calls can be batched together.

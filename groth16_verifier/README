# Groth16 Verifier Examples

This directory contains two Groth16 verifier contracts:

- BLS12-381 implementation: [bls12-381](bls12-381)
- BN254 implementation: [bn254](bn254)

Each subpackage includes its own contract, tests, and data artifacts. Shared Rust toolchain configuration remains at the workspace root.

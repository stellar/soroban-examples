# Increment
This contract will get a counter value from storage (or use the value 0 if no value has been stored yet), and increment this counter every time it's called. The example is used for the [Storage](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/build/smart-contracts/example-contracts/storage) example contract in the documentation.

## Test
For a quick test of the smart contract, run a test using the provided test file, `increment/src/test.rs`. The test will just return a pass/fail result, but itâ€™s a convenient way to check if the code works, without deploying and invoking the contract manually. The test file also demonstates how to invoke the smart contract. 

From the root of the contract run this command:

```
cargo test
```

You should see the output:

```
running 1 test
test test::test ... ok
```

See the main [README](../README.md) file for information about how to build and invoke the code using the CLI.

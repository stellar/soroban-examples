# Logging
The logging example demonstrates how to log for the purpose of debugging.

Logs in contracts are only visible in tests, or when executing contracts using `stellar-cli`. Logs are only compiled into the contract if the `debug-assertions` Rust compiler option is enabled.

## Test
For a quick test of the smart contract, run a test using the provided test file, `logging/src/test.rs`. The test will just return a pass/fail result, but itâ€™s a convenient way to check if the code works, without deploying and invoking the contract manually. The test file also demonstates how to invoke the smart contract. 

From the root of the contract run this command:

```
cargo test
```

You should see the output:

```
running 1 test
test test::test ... ok
```

See the main [README](../README.md) file for information about how to build and invoke the code using the CLI.

# Simple Account
This a minimal exapmle of an account contract. The account is owned by a single ed25519 public key that is also used for authentication. For a more advanced example that demonstrates all the capabilities of the soroban account contracts see the `account` example.


## Test
For a quick test of the smart contract, run a test using the provided test file, `simple_account/src/test.rs`. The test will just return a pass/fail result, but itâ€™s a convenient way to check if the code works, without deploying and invoking the contract manually. The test file also demonstates how to invoke the smart contract. 

From the root of the contract run this command:

```
cargo test
```

You should see the output:

```
running 1 test
test test::test ... ok
```

See the main [README](../README.md) file for information about how to build and invoke the code using the CLI.
